# S&P 500 Analysis
Analysis of an S&amp;P 500 dataset spanning 13 years, involving day to day stock data on every asset added and removed from the S&amp;P 500 from 2013-2023. The data was used to predict stock market trends



## The S&P 500 Dataset
The S&P 500, often considered the pulse of the U.S. stock market, represents a broad swath of industries and is frequently used as a benchmark for the overall market's health. The dataset in question, sourced from Kaggle, offers a deep dive into this financial behemoth, chronicling its daily movements over a span of 13 years, from 2010 to July 2023.
Comprising a staggering 2,516 columns and 3,401 rows, this dataset is nothing short of a financial encyclopedia. Each row captures a day in the life of the stock market, detailing the **high, close, open, low, and volume** of every stock listed in the S&P 500 on that particular day. Such granularity allows for intricate analyses, from understanding individual stock trajectories to discerning overarching market trends.
However, like any real-world dataset, it comes with its quirks. Notably, some rows contain 'N/A' values. This isn't a mere oversight or a data collection error. Instead, these 'N/A' entries tell a story of the dynamic nature of the S&P 500. Over the years, the composition of the S&P 500 has not remained static. Companies, based on their market capitalization and other criteria, are periodically added to or removed from the index. When a company is introduced into the S&P 500, its historical data prior to its inclusion is naturally absent, leading to 'N/A' entries for those dates. Conversely, when a company is removed, its data ceases to update, resulting in subsequent 'N/A' values.
This aspect of the dataset underscores the evolving nature of the stock market. The S&P 500's constituents change over time, reflecting shifts in the economic landscape, emerging industries, and the rise and fall of corporate giants. While these 'N/A' entries might pose challenges during data preprocessing, they also serve as markers of the market's history, indicating periods of transition and transformation.
In essence, this S&P 500 dataset is more than just a collection of numbers. It's a historical record, capturing the ebbs and flows of the U.S. stock market over 13 years. Whether one is looking to study individual stock performances, industry trends, or the broader market movements, this dataset provides a treasure trove of insights waiting to be unearthed.





## Data Preprocessing
The journey of transforming raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis is both an art and a science. This is particularly true for financial datasets, where precision and clarity are paramount. My experience with the S&P 500 dataset from Kaggle underscores the significance of this preprocessing phase.
To begin, I embarked on the task of renaming columns, ensuring they were intuitive and easily interpretable. Such a step might seem trivial, but it's foundational. An intuitively named column simplifies the analysis process, allowing both the analyst and any future stakeholders to navigate the dataset with ease, without being bogged down by ambiguous or cryptic column names.
While the dataset was comprehensive, it wasn't without its quirks. Some columns had 'N/A' values, indicative of the dynamic nature of the S&P 500, where stocks are periodically added or removed. Rather than seeing these as mere gaps, they serve as markers of the market's evolution. However, for the sake of consistency and to avoid potential biases in the analysis, these columns were addressed.
A critical step was the conversion of all columns to numeric data types. Financial data, by its very nature, demands numerical analysis. Whether it's computing averages, identifying trends, or performing statistical tests, numeric data is a prerequisite. To validate the preprocessing steps, I visualized the close price of AAP and AAPL from 2010 to 2023. This not only served as a proof of concept but also offered a glimpse into the trajectories of these stocks over the years.

To provide a comprehensive view of the market's dynamics, I crafted a new data frame that aggregated key metrics: close, open, low, high, and volume. This consolidated view is invaluable for holistic market analysis, offering insights into overarching trends and patterns. Additionally, to forecast and analyze potential future movements, I introduced a "Tomorrow" column that displayed the close price for the subsequent day.One of the final, yet crucial, steps was making the dates the primary index of the dataset. Financial data is inherently temporal, and setting up the dataset for time series analysis ensures that chronological patterns can be discerned with ease.
